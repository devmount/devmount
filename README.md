I'm Andreas. I'm a freelance web developer, creator and consultant in Berlin, Germany. I love God and I do all my work unto him. I create and maintain websites, web apps and extensions for various Content Management Systems and also do some machine learning and NLP stuff. I publish articles and tutorials about web development and related topics on [DEV](https://dev.to/devmount), [Medium](https://medium.com/@devmount) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devmount). If you like my work, just drop me a 'thank you' or [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/devmount).

I'm Andreas. I'm a freelance web developer, creator and consultant in Berlin, Germany. I love God and I do all my work unto him. I create and maintain websites, web apps and extensions for various Content Management Systems and also do some machine learning and NLP stuff. I occasionally publish articles and tutorials about web development and related topics on [DEV](https://dev.to/devmount), [Medium](https://medium.com/@devmount) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devmount). If you like my work, just drop me a 'thank you' or [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/devmount).

- üì´ Contact me via [my website](https://devmount.de/en#contact), [Keybase](https://keybase.io/devmount) or [email](mailto:hello@devmount.de)
- ü§ì Fun fact: My first own computer was an Acer Travelmate 220 laptop with both, a floppy and a CD drive! What was yours?

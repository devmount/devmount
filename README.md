I'm Andreas. I'm a freelance web developer, creator and consultant in Berlin, Germany.
I love God and I do all my work unto him. I create and maintain websites, web apps and extensions for various Content Management Systems. I publish articles and tutorials about web development and related topics on [DEV](https://dev.to/devmount), [Medium](https://medium.com/@devmount) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devmount).

- 💬 Ask me about programming (Javascript, Python, PHP, CSS, VueJS), home office, balancing work and family (especially with kids), freelancing (get projects, get clients)
- 📫 Contact me via [my website](https://devmount.de/en#contact), [Keybase](https://keybase.io/devmount) or [email](hello@devmount.de)
- 🤓 Fun fact: My first own computer was an Acer Travelmate 220 laptop with both, a floppy and a CD drive! What was yours?

Keep on coding!

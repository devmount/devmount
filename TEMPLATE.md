I'm Andreas. I'm a freelance web developer, creator and consultant in Berlin, Germany. I love God and I do all my work unto him. I build applications that run in your browser and on your web server. I publish articles and tutorials about web technologies and related topics on [DEV](https://dev.to/devmount), [Medium](https://medium.com/@devmount) and [Mastodon](https://mstdn.io/@devmount). If you get value from my work, just drop me a 'thank you' or [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/devmount).

- 💬 Ask me about programming (JS, TS, Python, PHP, CSS, Vue), balancing work and family or freelancing
- 📫 Check [my website](https://devmount.com) or [email me](mailto:hello@devmount.com)
- 🤓 Fun fact: My first own computer was an Acer Travelmate 220 laptop with both, a floppy and a CD drive!
